SportHub is a modern, full-stack web platform designed to centralize and streamline all sports trial announcements across India. It empowers organizers to easily create and publish trial events with eligibility criteria, brochures, and location details, while enabling athletes to discover, filter, and apply to relevant trials based on sport, location, and age. The backend, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, handles secure authentication, trial management, role-based access, and real-time notifications. Users receive updates through email or push notifications, ensuring no opportunity is missed. Organizers benefit from wider reach and digital participant tracking, while athletes enjoy a fair, transparent, and organized trial discovery experience. SportHub bridges the gap between talent and opportunity â€” making sports trials more accessible, efficient, and equitable.
